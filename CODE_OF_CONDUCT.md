# Echo-Meter Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As maintainers and contributors of the echo-meter project, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a welcoming, harassment-free, and friendly experience for everyone, regardless of experience level, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Echo-meter is focused on Linux users and contributors; while we encourage broad participation, please note that echo-meter is not intended for BSD platforms.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Offering friendly and constructive feedback
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Helping newcomers feel comfortable and supported

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery or unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional, open source, or Linux community setting

## Our Focus

This project is for Linux users and contributors. Please avoid off-topic discussions, such as promotion of BSD support. Let’s keep the focus on making echo-meter great for all Linux environments, especially tiling window managers.

## Reporting Issues

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at nithin3dev@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.
